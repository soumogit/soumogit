### 👋 Hi, I'm Soumodip Ghosh

[cite_start]I'm a recent **graduate** from **VIT Vellore** with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication (CGPA: 8.58)[cite: 3, 4, 10]. I'm passionate about building full-stack applications and solving problems with code.

[cite_start]I'm excited to be joining **TCS** as a **System Engineer (Digital Role)**[cite: 17, 20].

Previously, I've had the opportunity to work as:
* [cite_start]**Head of Technical Operations** at Skilledity, where I led a team of 15 and built a full-stack website from scratch[cite: 21, 22, 23].
* [cite_start]**Research Intern** at **DRDO**, developing a microcontroller-based IoT fire detection system[cite: 24, 26].
* [cite_start]**JAVA Developer** at Tech Straver, where I built several GUI-based applications.
